### Implementation Roadmap

#### Phased Rollout Strategy

Strategic implementation from pilot program to pan-India deployment

**Planning: Pilot Program (Year 1)**

- Limited scope validation with one Zonal Railway division
- 100% progress: Single Zonal Railway selection, 2-3 strategic manufacturers, Elastic rail clips & fishplates focus, KPI-driven success metrics

**Zonal Rollout (Years 2-3)**

- Full zonal deployment with system refinement
- 0% progress: All divisions within pilot zone, expanded component types, more manufacturing partners, workflow optimization

**Pan-India Deployment (Years 4-5)**

- Network-wide implementation with central monitoring
- 0% progress: Zone-by-zone rollout, central command center, IREPS procurement mandate, universal adoption
